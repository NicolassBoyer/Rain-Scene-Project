# Project: rainscene
This is not my project report. Please check the report itself for grading. 
This is just credit for the models and textures I've used in the project.

# code that not written by me:
- stb_image does not belong to me. It is a source file taken from the web in order to implement images in the project.
  It is also present in the lab capsules.
  You can find it in the lab capsules or at https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h

- tinyobjloader is also not mine, and we were given permission to use it as well as part of our project.
